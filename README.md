# Hierarchy-for-nonlocality-detection
It provides an approximation of the local set of correlations through a semidefinite programing (SDP) relaxation. The software is capable to address a completely general (N,m,d) scenario, namely involving N parties, m measurement settings with d outcomes per party.
Thanks to its efficient scaling, it is particularly suited for implementation in scenarios with a high number of parties and/or measurements. 
The software can be seen as a relaxation of the usual linear programming techniques and provides all the tools that are usually needed in the study of nonlocal correlations: nonlocality detection, estimation of robustness to white noise and extraction of Bell inequalities.
